# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### CycleDetectedException

**Error**: "Creating this relationship would form a cycle"

**Cause**: You're trying to create a relationship that would make a label both an ancestor and descendant of another.

**Solution**: Review your hierarchy. DAGs don't allow cycles. If you need bidirectional relationships, use a separate model.

```php
// Check existing relationships
$label->relationships;        // Where this label is parent
$label->reverseRelationships; // Where this label is child
```

### SelfReferenceException

**Error**: "Cannot create self-referential relationship"

**Cause**: Attempting to make a label its own parent.

**Solution**: Use two different labels for parent and child.

### InvalidRouteException

**Error**: "Route not found: {path}"

**Cause**: Trying to attach a route that doesn't exist.

**Solutions**:

1. Create the labels and relationships first:
```php
$root = Label::create(['name' => 'Priority']);
$child = Label::create(['name' => 'High']);
LabelRelationship::create([
    'parent_label_id' => $root->id,
    'child_label_id' => $child->id,
]);
// Now route 'priority.high' exists
```

2. Check if routes need regeneration:
```bash
php artisan label-tree:route:regenerate
```

### RoutesInUseException

**Error**: "Cannot delete relationship: N attachments exist on routes: {paths}"

**Cause**: Trying to delete a relationship when models are attached to affected routes.

**Solutions**:

1. Detach models first:
```php
foreach ($relationship->getAffectedRoutes() as $route) {
    // Handle attachments
}
```

2. Cascade delete (removes attachments):
```php
$relationship->deleteAndCascade();
```

3. Migrate to replacement route:
```php
$relationship->deleteAndReplace('alternative.path');
```

### Routes Not Updating

**Symptoms**: Routes don't reflect recent relationship changes.

**Cause**: Observer may not have fired, or manual database changes.

**Solution**: Regenerate routes manually:
```bash
php artisan label-tree:route:regenerate
```

### Pattern Matching Not Working

**Symptoms**: `wherePathMatches()` returns unexpected results.

**Cause**: Pattern syntax confusion or database adapter issue.

**Debug**:

1. Check the pattern syntax:
   - `*` matches zero or more segments
   - `priority.*` matches `priority`, `priority.high`, `priority.high.critical`

2. Test pattern in tinker:
```php
LabelRoute::wherePathMatches('priority.*')->toSql();
LabelRoute::wherePathMatches('priority.*')->get();
```

3. Try explicit LIKE for comparison:
```php
LabelRoute::wherePathLike('priority%')->get();
```

### SQLite Regex Issues

**Symptoms**: Pattern matching slow or not working in SQLite.

**Cause**: SQLite doesn't have native regex; uses PHP fallback.

**Note**: SQLite adapter is for testing only. Use PostgreSQL or MySQL in production.

## Validation

Run the validation command to check for issues:

```bash
php artisan label-tree:validate
```

This checks for:
- Cycles in the relationship graph
- Orphaned routes (routes without corresponding relationships)
- Missing routes (relationships without generated routes)
- Invalid references

## Debugging Tips

### View Graph Structure

```bash
php artisan label-tree:visualize
```

### List All Routes

```bash
php artisan label-tree:route:list
```

### Check Relationship Integrity

```php
// Find relationships with missing labels
LabelRelationship::whereDoesntHave('parent')->get();
LabelRelationship::whereDoesntHave('child')->get();
```

### Trace Route Generation

```php
use Birdcar\LabelTree\Services\RouteGenerator;

$generator = app(RouteGenerator::class);

// Regenerate with logging
DB::enableQueryLog();
$generator->regenerateAll();
dd(DB::getQueryLog());
```

## Getting Help

1. Check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/birdcar/laravel-label-tree/issues)
2. Run `php artisan label-tree:validate` and include output
3. Include your Laravel and PHP versions
4. Provide minimal reproduction steps
